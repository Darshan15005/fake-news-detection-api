# 📰 Fake News Detection API

A Machine Learning powered **Django REST API** that classifies news articles 
as **FAKE or REAL** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning models.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end fake news detection system:
- Trains multiple ML models
- Selects the best-performing pipeline
- Exposes predictions via a REST API
- Supports both **text input** and **URL-based article extraction**

## 📊 Models Trained & Compared

| Model               | Tuned | Used GridSearch | Final Accuracy |
|---------------------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Logistic Regression |  ✅  |        ✅       |     ~99%       |
| Random Forest       |  ✅  |        ✅       |     ~98–99%    |
| Gradient Boosting   |  ✅  |        ✅       |     ~98%       |

Best model is saved as a **single pipeline** (`fake_news_model.pkl`).
